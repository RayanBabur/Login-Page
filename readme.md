Write your own client id, client secret and callback URI in .env file by creating a new application in google developers console for goolgle authentication and in microsoft Azure for microsoft authentication.

Callback URI should be exact same as URL of page that you want only authenticated users to access.

Also set routes according to your website.

Also, please create your own mongoDB database and connect it with source.
I created just a free test shared cloud database of about just 500MB.

Also remove console logs after adding scopes according to your requirements.
